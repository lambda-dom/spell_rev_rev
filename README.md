# spell_rev_rev README

Revisions (patches and tweaks) for Spell Revisions.

## A. Installation.

First, download and install the gr-lib WeiDU library -- consult the [readme](https://github.com/lambda-dom/gr-lib) for more details. Then install the mod just like you would install any other WeiDU mod.

## B. Requirements.

[Spell Revisions](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/SpellRevisions) is obviously necessary; use the latest v4 beta 18 release. The mod uses EE features, so it does not work on classical editions or platforms like BGT that rely on it. It is also tested with the game patched to version v2.6.

The mod is pure WeiDU, so it should be safe from operating system variations. While it was tested in linux, using a case-insensitive ext4 partition -- see [here](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/28516-the-linux-users-guide-to-installing-mods-on-the-enhanced-editions/) for details on how to set it up -- it should work just fine on Windows or MacOS. If it does not, patches are welcome.

## C. Tools used.

* [WeiDU](https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu)
* [Near Infinity](https://github.com/Argent77/NearInfinity)
