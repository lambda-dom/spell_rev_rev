# A. Tweaks.

Contrary to the patches component, tweaks are grouped and applied in bulk, not per-spell. If there is some particular tweak you do not want, just edit the tweaks.2da file and turn the value in the second column from 1 to 0.

## A. 1. Standardize Summoning Duration.

This tweak standardizes duration of summons, both Wizard's Monster Summoning and Druid's Animal Summoning, to 5 turns. In SR they have a duration of 2 to 3 turns so this tweak increases the time they stay around.
